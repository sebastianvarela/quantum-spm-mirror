/**
 These are Event Flags, which allow you to specify special parameters for events you send using the SDK.
 For example, sending an event with a value of "12.34" and flag of `QMEventTypeConversion` will mark that event as a $12.34 conversion (or whatever currency your sub uses).
 Examples:
 ```swift
 QMNative.sendEvent(withID: 12, value: "19.95", flags: .conversion);
 ```
 Objective-C:
 ```objc
 [QMNative sendEventWithID:12 value:@"19.95" flags:QMEventTypeConversion];
 ```
 ### Event ID
 
 You can find the event id of the event you'd like to fire in your code by going to Settings > Events within your Quantum Metric subscription interface on the web. If you do not have any events setup, you can set one up there, and it'll create a new event id for you to use to send events.
 
 ## Eventing use cases
 
 Although Quantum can remotely configure a number of events, sending some events within your code will allow you to harness the full power of Quantum. Common use cases for sending events manually include:
 
 ### Tracking internal errors
 
 Almost every developer has some kind of comment in their code that looks like this:
 ```objc
 if (...) {
    //...
 } else {
    //this should never happen!
 }
 ```
 
 But somehow, the `//this should never happen!` part, happens! If this is occuring for you, and you want to see what the user did in order to get to that point, you can fire an event (and as the event value, maybe even pass in some debug information to give you some more clues).
 
 Let's take a look at what we could send:
 ```objc
 if (...) {
    //...
 } else {
    //this should never happen, but if it does, let's fire an event so we can see these sessions in Quantum
    [QMNative sendEventWithID:2 value:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"dictionary: %@ integer: %i, string: %@", myDictionary, myInteger, myString]];
 }
 ```
 
 This way, the value will contain your dictionary/integer/string or whatever else you want to pass through, to help debug further.
 
 ### Tracking occurences of things happening
 
 You may want to track some interactions, like how many search results they view before selecting one, or how many images they view before deciding to add a product to their cart. These types of examples may require writing a little code to keep track of the number of interactions that happen, and then sending off that value.
 
 ```objc
 [QMNative sendEventWithID:3 value:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%i", numberOfImagesUserViewed]];
 ```

 ### Time to action
 
 Another common metric is how long it takes users to complete a task. If you record the times users do things, such as view cart, and then find the time difference when the checkout completes, you can record (in seconds), how long that took, if your goal was to optimize for faster/easier checkout times.
 
 ```objc
 [QMNative sendEventWithID:4 value:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%i", numberOfSecondsBetweenUserActions]];
 ```

 These are just some ideas to get you started. Quantum can measure whatever you pass it, so you can keep an eye on various metrics, and setup alerts if something goes higher or lower than expected. If you have any questions, please contact us so we can help!

 - QMContentTypeViewControllerClass
